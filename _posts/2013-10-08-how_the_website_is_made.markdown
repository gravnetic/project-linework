title: How projectlinework.org runs
---

Project Linework's new homes comes with a few updates but aims to keep things simple. All of your linework sets currently include downloads in four file types: **Shapefile, Geojson, Topojson, and Adobe Illustrator**. These have been hand-crafted for your use in any way you please.

The download packages are hosted by the [GISCollective](http://giscollective.org) and the website is running completely on [Github pages](https://github.com/mapsam/project-linework/tree/gh-pages) with jekyll. The most up-to-date linework sets can also be [found on Github](https://github.com/mapsam/project-linework), but we urge you to download from the links on the website for fully-functioning data sets.
